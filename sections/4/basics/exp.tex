\begin{theorem} 
\label{thm::OEX_exponential}
   The function $\exp(x)=e^x$ is \effectivelyOpen. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let us take any arbitrary open set $U$ with an effective open exhaustion.
    Since $\exp(x)>0$, we know that $\exp^{-1}(U) = \exp^{-1}(U\cap (0, +\infty))$.
    We want to come up with an effective open exhaustion for $\exp^{-1}(U\cap (0, +\infty))$.
    Using Remark \ref{remark::OEX_for_interval_implies_OEX_for_all_open_sets}, we only need to prove that the preimage of any open interval $I =(a,b)$ with $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$ has an effective open exhaustion.
    The pre-image function for $\exp$ is $\ln$. Since $ln$ is only defined on positive reals, $\ln(I) = \ln((a,b)\cap (0, +\infty))$.\\
    We know that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The function $\ln$ is monotonically increasing.
        \item The function $\ln$ is \WhileCC-approximable (using Theorem \ref{theorem::log}).
        \item The function $\ln$ is defined on $(a,b)\cap (0, +\infty)$.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence, Theorem \ref{thm::OEX_by_WCC_approximability} gives us an open exhaustion for $ln(I)$, and this completes the proof.
\end{proof}
