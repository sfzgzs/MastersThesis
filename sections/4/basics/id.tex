\begin{theorem} 
\label{thm::OEX_identity}
   The identity function $\id(x)=x$ is \effectivelyOpen{}. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $U$ be an open set with an open exhaustion $X$.
    By definition $\id^{-1}(U) = U$, and hence $X$ is clearly an effective open exhaustion for $\id^{-1}(U)$ as well.
\end{proof}
