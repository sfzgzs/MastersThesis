This section is a first step towards proving that elementary functions are acceptable.
In this section, we present an inductive construction for an effective open exhaustion for the domain of any arbitrary elementary function.
To simplify the proofs, we will strengthen the claim and prove the following statement:
\begin{center}
    For any open set $U$ with an \effectiveopenexhaustion{}, $f^{-1}(U)$ has an effective open exhaustion.
\end{center}
In particular, this stronger formulation makes the composition case trivial.
\begin{definition}[Exhaustion-reflecting function]
\label{def::effectively_open_functions}
    Let $f:\Reals\to\Reals$. We call $f$ \textit{exhaustion-reflecting} if for any open set $U$ with an effective open exhaustion, $f^{-1}(U)\neq \emptyset$ implies that $f^{-1}(U)$ has an effective open exhaustion.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    If $f$ is \effectivelyOpen, since $\Reals$ is an open set with an open exhaustion, $f^{-1}(\Reals)=\dom(f)$ has an effective exhaustion.
\end{remark}
