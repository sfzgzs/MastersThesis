\section{Composition of Functions}
\label{sec5::subsection::composition}
In this section, we prove that the composition of two \effectivelyOpen{} functions is \effectivelyOpen{}.
\begin{theorem} 
\label{thm::composition_has_OEX}
    Let $f:\Reals^n\to \Reals^k$ and $g:\Reals^m\to \Reals^n$ be \effectivelyOpen, then $f\circ g:\Reals^m\to \Reals^k$ is also \effectivelyOpen.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $U\subseteq \Reals^k$ be an open set with an effective open exhaustion. Then by assumption on $f$, $f^{-1}(U) \subseteq \Reals^n$ has an effective open exhaustion, and hence $g^{-1}(f^{-1}(U)) \subseteq \Reals^m$ has an effective open exhaustion.
\end{proof}
