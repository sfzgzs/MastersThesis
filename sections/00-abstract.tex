    In this thesis, we study models of computation for partial functions on the reals.

    Existing work \citep{ModelOfCompForPartFunc_MingQuanFuAndJeffZucker, ComputationByWhileProgramsOnTopologicalPartialAlgebras_TuckerAndZucker, AbstractVSConcreteComputationOnMetricPartialAlgebras_TuckerZucker_2004}
    studies classes of computable partial functions on $\Reals$, namely 
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item GL-computability,
    \item tracking computability,
    \item multipolynomial
    approximability, and
    \item \WhileCC-approximability.
\end{itemize}
% [Acceptability: Why do we care?]
    \citet{ModelOfCompForPartFunc_MingQuanFuAndJeffZucker} show that all these four models of computation are equivalent when we restrict our attention to a specific class of functions we call ``acceptable'' functions.
    This means, within the realm of acceptable functions, we can work with \WhileCC-approximability without giving up expressivity and transfer results amongst the models.
    

% [Are these conditions useful?]
    However, it was previously unknown whether the class of acceptable functions is sufficiently large to include many common functions, such as the elementary functions.
    In this thesis, we solve the conjecture posed by \citet{ModelOfCompForPartFunc_MingQuanFuAndJeffZucker} and show that all elementary functions are acceptable. We also prove that the elementary functions are \WhileCC-approximable and therefore computable in all the aforementioned models of computation.
