In this section, we discuss \WhileCCapproximability{} of the function $\ln(f(x))$ for any \WhileCC-approximable function $f$.

Since we already have a way of approximating the inverse of $\ln(x)$, which is $\exp(x)$, we can use it to construct a \WhileCC-procedure that approximates $\ln(f(x))$ for a \WhileCC-approximable function $f$.
