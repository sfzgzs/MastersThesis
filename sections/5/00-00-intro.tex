In this section, we prove that all elementary functions are acceptable.

Recalling the Definition \ref{def::acceptable_function}, a function $f:\Reals\to\Reals$ is \emph{\acceptable{}} if there exists a sequence $X$ where:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $X$ is an \effectiveopenexhaustion{} for $\dom(f)$ , and
        \item $f$ is effectively locally uniformly continuous w.r.t.\null{} $X$.
    \end{enumerate}
In the previous section, we proved that all elementary functions are \effectivelyOpen{}, and hence have a domain with an effective open exhaustion. In this section, we complete the proof of acceptability of the elementary functions by proving that the elementary functions are effectively locally uniformly continuous with respect to the aforementioned exhaustion.
