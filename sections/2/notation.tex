\paragraph*{\large{Notation.}}
 In this thesis, we use $\to$ to denote partial functions and $\totalTo$ for total functions.
 Contrary to the normal convention, the function $\log$ denotes $\log_2$ and $\ln$ is used for $\log_e$.
 We write $\bar{x}$ to denote a sequence $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n$ and define $\abs{\bar{x}} = n$.
 Throughout this work, the equality symbol $=$ denotes Kleene equality, meaning either both sides of the equality are defined and are equal, or both sides are undefined. The symbol $\phi$ \index{$\phi$} denotes an enumeration of all computable functions on $\Nats$ and is used in Sections \ref{sec::realizability} and \ref{sec::alpha-computability}. In this thesis, ``continuity of a function on its domain'' is used in the standard sense.
